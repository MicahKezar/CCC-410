# CCC-410
## About
  Welcome to my capstone page. This is where the meat and potatoes of my project will be displayed. From the brainstorming process, all the way to the inevitable end. Multiple ideas will be displayed. Complex terminology will be explained in the clearest and most concise way possible without taking away too much from the fundamentals of Information Technology. 
  
  I hope this overarching project will give you a glimpse into my philosophies and what I value most in the world of cybersecurity; without compromising the safety of traversing the world-wide-web.

# Final Project: [SEC-300-71: Topics in Security - Spring 2024](https://github.com/MicahKezar/CCC-410/blob/main/Radio%20Frequency%20Security/Radio%20Frequency%20Security.md)
Radio Frequency Security is a five week one credit section of SEC300 that touches on radio frequencies and associated security protocols and principles. This course will dive into the ways radio frequencies affect our daily lives and how common protocols like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, Radio function on a detailed level. Additional emphasis will be put on the security methods that are implemented in different protocols. Students will be able to gain hands-on experience working with RF hardware as well as learning the legal and ethical implications related to RF security.
