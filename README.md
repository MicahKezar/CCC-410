## About
  Welcome to my capstone page. This is where the meat and potatoes of my project will be displayed. From the brainstorming process, all the way to the inevitable end. Multiple ideas will be displayed. Complex terminology will be explained in the clearest and most concise way possible without taking away too much from the fundamentals of the Information Technology lingo. 
  
  I hope this overarching project will give you a glimpse into my philosophies and what I value most in the world of cybersecurity; without compromising the safety of traversing the world-wide-web.
