# Topic Ideas
> :bulb: Here are the list of the topic ideas I have for my capstone project. I will include not only the idea, but the research, analysis, and the general plan on how these ideas can be realistically achieved. Saying, "I'm going to solve world hunger!" without providing any research or plan behind my idea would lead to many believing I'm not well-equipped to accomplish nearly anything to that extent. Therefore, I will provide as much detail as possible while still keeping the topic ideas in the "mockup" stage.
