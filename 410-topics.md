# Topic Ideas
> :bulb: Here are the list of the topic ideas I have for my capstone project. I will include not only the idea, but the research, analysis, and the general plan on how these ideas can be realistically achieved. Saying, "I'm going to solve world hunger!" without providing any research or plan behind my idea would lead to many believing I'm not well-equipped to accomplish nearly anything to that extent. Therefore, I will provide as much detail as possible while still keeping the topic ideas in the "mockup" stage.

[SSMS](https://github.com/MicahKezar/CCC-410/blob/main/SSMS/SSMS.md) (Secure Short Message Service) is a custom protocol based off of the widely used SMS (Short Message Service) protocol used for text messaging by most telephone, internet, and mobile devices.

My goal is to provide an additional layer of security to the pre-existing SMS protocol. I am very interested in pursuing this topic as SMS is very unsecure, and is widely used across the globe. Text messages are transfered via plaintext, meaning anyone with the capability of listening in on cell towers can have access to a plethora of private information. I plan on using the SMS infrastracture to add on additional encryption to ensure the safety and privacy of everyones messages.

[Radio Frequency Security](https://github.com/MicahKezar/CCC-410/wiki/Design-Project-2) Is a course designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the modern cellular framework, the security measures, encryption techniques, cellular protocols, and radio transmission systems employed in modern cellular networks. Students will learn the importance of securing mobile communications, as well as the legal and ethical implications related to cellular security.
