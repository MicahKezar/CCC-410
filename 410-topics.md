# Topic Ideas
> :bulb: Here are the list of the topic ideas I have for my capstone project. I will include not only the idea, but the research, analysis, and the general plan on how these ideas can be realistically achieved. Saying, "I'm going to solve world hunger!" without providing any research or plan behind my idea would lead to many believing I'm not well-equipped to accomplish nearly anything to that extent. Therefore, I will provide as much detail as possible while still keeping the topic ideas in the "mockup" stage.

[SSMS](https://github.com/MicahKezar/CCC-410/blob/main/SSMS/SSMS.md) (Secure Short Message Service) is a custom protocol based off of the widely used SMS (Short Message Service) protocol used for text messaging by most telephone, internet, and mobile devices.

My goal is to provide an additional layer of security to the pre-existing SMS protocol. I am very interested in pursuing this topic as SMS is very unsecure, and is widely used across the globe. Text messages are transfered via plaintext, meaning anyone with the capability of listening in on cell towers can have access to a plethora of private information. I plan on using the SMS infrastracture to add on additional encryption to ensure the safety and privacy of everyones messages.

[DEXploit](https://github.com/MicahKezar/CCC-410/blob/main/DEXploit/DEXploit.md) Is a service that will keep note of your hardware and software applications and report to you whenever there are new CVE Exploits based off of those parameters. 

My goal is to deliver an experience where one can input their Computer Parts (ex: GPU, CPU, Motherboard, etc.), applications being used (ex: Microsoft Outlook, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) and deliver them a real-time experience to notify them whenever one of their hardware or software applications are vulnerable to new attacks.
